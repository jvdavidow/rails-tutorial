# Models

This is an outline of the models for the app.

## Post

Our post model is the whole reason someone is coming to the app. We'll start it off simple and build it up.

* title - title of the post
* body - main part of the post

## Comment

Users will want to build a community by talking with each other about a given post. This will be done via comments. We'll associate with user's later.

* body - main part of the comment
* post_id - which post it belongs to
